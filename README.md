## Description/Goals

_Create a web application for two players to play Pig Dice_
_Pig is a simple dice game which in its basic form is playable with just a single die. You win by being the first player to score 100 or more points._

## Objectives
_How to Play_

* Choose a player to go first. That player clicks dice button and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

* If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and then player 2's turn.

* Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

_How to win_

* The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
